# The Winning Resume Package

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand how to create a successful resume, cover letter and LinkedIn Profile that will get noticed

* Communicate your GA experience effectively on your resume and LinkedIn

* Organize content on your resume to tell the story of your career transition

* Create a draft resume and cover letter

* Update your LinkedIn profile 

## Framing: (5/0) 

We know that you likely don’t know yet what you want to do or where to even begin with your resume; that’s okay! Our goal today is to show you what success looks like, and to get your content into a draft that you can continue to work on throughout the course.

## I do: (10/15) 

**The secret six:**

1. Your resume should be an advertisement – not an autobiography

2. Write for the reader – not yourself

3. Make it easy to be screened in – not out

4. Tell them only what they want to hear

5. Give proof – not promises

6. One size does NOT fit all situations

Do your research - your resume is your personal advertisement

**The format:**

1. Introduction (centered): Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio

2. Brand Statement (centered) {You do not need to label it as "Brand Statement"}

3. Skills (List your hard skills - tools, languages, programming)

4. Relevant Experience:

    1. General Assembly XX IMMERSIVE Experience + description

    2. Projects

    3. Any other experience related to data science

5. Professional Experience

    4. List chronologically

6. Education

    5. List GA again, but without a description

7. Side Hustle/hobbies/personal interests/awards (optional)

    6. Anything else that you are really proud of that you’d like to share

Writing sucessful bullets: 

- Begin with verbs (Developed, Created, Designed, Managed, Led), and be sure to vary them 

- [Be specific with your content ](http://everyvowel.com/resume-2/)

- Remember to provide proof...show the data. Don't just say "Led a team". Rather, "Led a team of five to achieve a growth rate that increased revenue 80%" 

## You do: (10/40) 

Turn to your neighbor. Choose a bullet on your resume to make quantifiable and brainstorm together on how to make it quantifiable and more specific

## Cover Letters  

Don't stress out about Cover Letters. This is another tool to gain insight into who you are as a candidate that should be an addition to your resume to demonstrate why you would be a great addition to their team.  

Use the KISS method-Keep It Simple Stupid. 

Format: 

Use the same heading as your resume {Name, phone number, email, location (just city, state), link to portfolio}

Paragraph 1: Say what you are applying for and how you heard about the organization. 

Paragraph 2: State why THEY are great. 

Paragraph 3: State why YOU are great. 

Paragraph 4: State why you BOTH are great and would be a good fit. 

Paragraph 5: Call to Action and Contact Info.

## LinkedIn: (20/60) 

LinkedIn is an incredibly valuable tool that can completely shift your networking strategies 

Find your career crushes and ask them to coffee.
- Hi Name! I'm a current Data Science student at GA and I'm looking to learn more about the tech field in CITY. I was really impressed by your career path and would love to pick your brain. Would you be open to coffee (my treat) or a quick phone call in the next couple of weeks? 

Whenever you are interested in an organization, search to see if you have any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree connections to that organization, and then ask for a connection
- Hi NAME! I hope everything is going well with you! As you may know, I've just started GA's Data Science immersive course, and I'm loving it so far! I'll soon be job searching and am looking to learn more about the tech field in CITY. I saw that you are connected to ABC and I'm very interested in that organization. Would you be willing to connect us? I've written an email below that you can copy and paste: 

### Updating your LinkedIn 
First of all, turn off notifications when you are making lots of edits (Click your headshot > Settings + Privacy > Privacy tab > "Sharing Profile Edits" half way down the page)

Make sure your contact information is listed (Click on your headshot > scroll down halfway down the page on the righthand side "Contact and Personal Info" 

Update your tagline (under your name)
- Examples: Data Scientist (Even if you don't feel like it's true, put it up there!) 

Once your resume is final, you can copy and paste the content into LinkedIn 

Add your GA projects to your GA section 
- Use the "Add a section to your GA Profile" and then look for "Projects" 

Ask for recommendations: former bosses, coworkers, clients 
- You can use the [recommendation section on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/96/request-a-recommendation?lang=en) and be sure to also follow up with a personalized note: 
- Example: Hi NAME, I hope everything is going well with you! As you may know, I've just started GA's Data Science immersive course, and I'm loving it so far! I'll soon be job searching and am looking to build up my LinkedIn profile, would you be willing to write me a recommendation? I'd be happy to draft some ideas for you if that's helpful.
