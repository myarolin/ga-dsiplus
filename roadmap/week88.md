#  Defining your Non-negotiables and Negotiating like a Boss 

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand what actually makes you happy in your career

* Communicate what you are looking for in your career to future employers

* Have a way to decide if an organization is a good fit for you

* Know when to negotiate and talk money in the interview process

* Practicing negotiation

## Framing: (5/5)

What is a must-have in your next career? How do you narrow down your job search strategy? What is the must-have versus nice-to-have? Being able to communicate WHY you want a job is just as important as why you are a good fit for a job. We will tackle these questions and more this week. Be ready with your Organizational Research for a deep dive. 

Negotiating can be hard and intimidating. No matter how many times you have negotiated, how much money you have, or if you are an employer or job seeker - we are all weird about money! We’ll give you the tools and practice today to make this process less intimidating for you.

## You do:

- Pull out a piece of paper or new document on your computer

- Think about the last 5 roles you have had. If you recently graduated think of volunteer roles you’ve had, roles in clubs, sports teams, or membership organizations.

- On the left hand side of the page right out all of the things you liked about each of those roles

- On the right hand side of the page list out all of the things that you didn’t like about the roles

**Think about: **

- Team structure - did you work alone or part of a team? Or both?

- Structure of the work environment - was it flexible? Bureaucratic? Creative? Lively? Quiet?

- Culture - was it fun? Serious? Creative? Supportive? Smart? Mission driven?

- Management style

- Commute

- Dress code

- Physical environment

- Salary

- Professional development and growth

- . . . and anything else!

Now, take a step back and look for any over-arching themes - what do you see?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Next, write down your core values professionally and personally. Don’t think too much about this, just what first comes into your head, and this will be a list that continues to grow. Some ideas:

* Integrity

* Authenticity

* Growth

* Kindness

* Peace

* Courage

* Adventure

* Generosity

* Making the world a better place

* Joy/play

* Creativity

What connections do you see between your values and your likes/dislikes?

## We do:

Open discussion

## You do:

Now look at your list of likes/dislikes and choose your 3 non-negotiables. The 3 things that you know if they aren’t there you won’t be able to be successful or happy.

## Negotiations: Knowing your Worth (10/75)

55% of women and 39% of men admit being too scared to negotiate.

## I do: When do you talk money in the process?

* Very beginning: They may ask for your ideal salary. Appropriate responses:

    * I expect to be fairly compensated for the role and the salary

    * Give a 5-10K range, make sure your ideal salary is at the bottom of that range

* It may come up again right before getting an official offer. Be careful here. Often they ask because they want to give you an offer that you are going to accept. Make sure to say that you want to see everything in writing before accepting

* Negotiation process truly begins when you get a **written offer**. Wait until you have a written offer because that will give you full leverage

## You do: Change three things (10/85)

## The process of negotiating (5/90)

**Know your minimum number**

How much does it cost to live your life?

* Rent

* Debt

* Utilities

* Insurance

* Travel (car payment, metro)

* Food

* Savings / debt payment

* Other . . . the things that make your day to day nicer than not!

**Do your research**

Average salaries for GA graduates:

DSI: $55K - $90K

Check Glassdoor, ask us, ask alumni, Google!

## We do (10/100)

Volunteer practice negotiating. Student volunteer will have just been offered a position, at 70K and they want 75K.

Class will provide feedback:

* Were they respectful, but strong?

* Did they present their value and give specific examples as to why they deserve more money?

* Did they approach the conversation looking for a win/win?

* Were they articulate, clear, and confident?

## You do: (20/120)

Turn to your neighbor. One of you will be the student and one will be the employer.

Students will practice negotiating for 5K more money. They’ve been offered 70K and they want 75K (5 minutes). Employers, your goal is to keep the number as low as possible, push back!

The employer will give feedback to the interviewee (5 minutes).

After 10 min, we’ll switch roles.

## We do: (5/125)

Open discussion - what worked/what didn’t. What do we need to practice moving forward?

## Homework 
Check your class calendar for your HW assingment due next Monday.
